# CS2100 Website Project

## Description
For my project I have decided to make a website for finding medical care. The medical car can be found and sorted how you need it to be. It can be location, price, speed, the best overrall, or just the one with the very specific care you need.

## Files
'about.html': about us page
'main.html': main pretty page to hook in the audience
'Homepage.html': basically going to be used as a big good looking navigation page
'Search.html': a page dedicated to the search engine and its findings
'services.html': a page to tell the people all the services we provide like searching or hiring one of the agents to schedule appointments.
'resources.html': page to provide resources we have or recommend to the people ranging from blogs to limited time opportunities
'contact.html': Page dedicated to ways you can get in touch and interract with the company and the site.
'project.css': This is the styling page for the website that gives all the sites the theme of the site.

## Usage
You should be able to open any of the .html files in a browser and see the pages.

##Installation
I do not believe there is any install necessarry all you have to do is download or clone the repository.
